        <h1>Prompts & Problem Solving</h1><br>
        <p>The initial prompt used to ideate this concept was,<br>
           "Political spin affecting public knowledge of clean<br>
            energy." By researching the concept of political<br>
            spin, I had found out it was mostly influenced by<br>
            social media algorithms spreading incendiary political<br>
            viewpoints. And drawing users into echo-chambers wherein<br>
            a users own thoughts stop being subject to constructive<br>
            criticism.<br><br>
            The "Curiousity" algorithm is designed to expose users to<br>
            more opinions on a problem or topic by slowly easing them<br>
            in using the best posts relating to them<br><br>
            The "Quality" algorithm is designed to ensure the most credible<br>
            posts are rewarded, instead of relying purely on how engaging they<br>
            are.</p>

        <p>All comments on the code are marked in green by hashtags<br>
        and explain how the components of the proposed algorithhm <br>
        help in achieving it's goals of favoring quality information,<br>
        and exposing the users to new opinions.</p>
